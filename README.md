Your job is to create a login system using React and Redux with whatever authorization method you want. 
The site should at least two pages, both accessible whether logged in or not.
Create account + Login page with email + password. 
Should show additional signin information (not required), show “user has logged in”, or redirect to main page 
Main page 
This can display login information or any other user information you wish to ask during sign up
The main page should change depending on if user is logged in or not

How to navigate between the two pages is completely up to you

Do not connect to database! -  purely a react and redux test -  account information can be stored in local storage or via any other locally accessible methods
This will test how you are able to handle changes in state and pass information across different pages.
